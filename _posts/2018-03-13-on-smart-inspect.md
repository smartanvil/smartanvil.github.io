This year we have been busy with many aspects of research on blockchain.

Two of the most challenging questions on our research are:
	
	1- How do we bring blockchain to the industry, in a less painful way?
	2- How do we build transparency in a hard-to-observe technology?
	

Our first approach for responding those questions was: Smart contracts are a great idea, but meanwhile they remain bytecode, no body can really trust on them. 

For addressing this first problematic, we wrote the Smart Inspect paper, along side a tool that allow us to inspect our smartcontracts. 

Here I leave the paper we published on the last SANER workshop.

Soon I will come with a new post on explaining briefly this subject. I hope you enjoy this paper as much as we do building this tools, ideas and writing!
