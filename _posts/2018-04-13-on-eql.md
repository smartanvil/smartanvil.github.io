As i already said in our smart-inspect paper post, we have been busy trying to respond some questions.



Some of the most challenging questions on our research are:
	
	1- How do we bring blockchain to the industry, in a less painful way?
	2- How do we build transparency in a hard-to-observe technology?
	3- How can we trust something that we cannot find our selves? 
	

This questions, in the proper environment, related with our personal experience in a cocktail mixed with many pluridisciplanary background and readings broguht us as a possible question the idea of a query language. 

Here I leave the paper we published on the last ICSE workshop.

Soon I will come with a new post on explaining briefly this subject. I hope you enjoy this paper as much as we do building this tools, ideas and writing!
