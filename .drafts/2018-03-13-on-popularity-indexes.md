## The index of popularity
	We can propose here two ways of indexing this popularity, once that is the overall popularity as a dead thing. A second one that explains the popularity on a certain point of the history.

	Pi(c) =    TxCount + versions + Pi(forks) 
               ---------------------------------------
		                 DoA

	Pi(c) = (TxDy(i) * 1 / (daysFromDay(i))) 		versions(i) * (e4 / daysFromDay(i))		
               -------------------------------------   +       -------------------------------------- 	+  Sum(Pi(Fork(i))) * 1 / daysFromDay(i)
			DoA						DaO Version(i)
